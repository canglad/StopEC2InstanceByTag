# StopEC2InstanceByTag
For your test/dev AWS account, you can use this CloudFormation template to create a scheduled CloudWatch task to stop running EC2 instances after work to save money, as long as those EC2 instances have a tag "AutoOff" with value "True". I create short-lived AWS dev/test accounts and their lifespan is only one week. This CloudFormation template is pretty useful for that purpose.
